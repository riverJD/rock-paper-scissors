'The Art of War'
A game of Spears, Bows, and Horses


BACKGROUND
Simple RPS game in javascript, flavored to Spears/Archers/Cavalry. I was inspired by playing Shogun Total War (1) many years ago, 
where at it's core it's really a rock-paper-scissors matchup of unit types.

Computer will randomly generate a choice which will be compared to user's input. I expanded the game to be five skirmishes which make up three battles. 
All three battles will be played even if win/loss is inevitable (ie 2 wins/losses).

There are a lot of things i would ultimately do different and focus more on object-oriented programming style, but it's a quick and dirty practice with javascript and
especially css.  Maybe I'll revisit someday.

HOW TO PLAY
Simply select the card that represents which unit you would like to play for the current skirmish. The rules are the same as Rock, Paper, Scissors but with a different
flavor.  

SPEARS beat CAVALRY
ARCHERS beat SPEARS
CAVALRY beat ARCHERS

Winning FIVE skirmishes wins a BATTLE. 
Whichever side wins the most battles out of THREE wins the game.

Thanks for checking it out!
